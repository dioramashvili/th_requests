This pyqt5-based app is a calculator for 4 possible geometric figures. It opens list of figures and an user should choose one of them.
Then the page is switched to the chosen figure calculator, where the user should enter parameters and press calculate button, to get area and perimeter.

You can also choose the color of the boxes on the first page by checking preferred color.

Each page has a back button to return on the main page at any moment.

The app has some rules, that control whether the parameters are set to 0, if so both area and perimeter/length are set to -1 as it is not possible.
